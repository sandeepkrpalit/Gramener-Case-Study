# Gramener-Case-Study

• The Purpose of this Case Study is to analyze the profile of customer/loan applicants
and based on that take decision whether to approve the loan OR reject the loan.
• If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in
a loss of business to the company.
• If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then
approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company .
